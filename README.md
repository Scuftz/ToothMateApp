### **Downloads:**

[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download)    
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

**Note: Both Node.JS and ngrok should be added to system path to simplify use. More information [here.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44272416/how-to-add-a-folder-to-path-environment-variable-in-windows-10-with-screensho)**  

**Another Note: Although Visual Studio Code is not absolutely required to run the application, it will simplify running both the server and phone app and will provide an environment for further development.**

### **Installing Dependencies**
Project dependencies are third party packages that extend the capabilities of our code. We have used many third party dependecies to gives us access to features you might find in the app, for instance PDFReader.

1. Open the ToothMateApp and ToothMateServer projects in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the terminal in each Visual Studio Code window ensuring it is in the directory of each project.
3. Type "npm install" in both terminal windows to install necessary dependencies for both projects on your device.

**Note: Alternatively you can open Windows command line instances in the root folders of both the ToothMateApp and ToothMateServer and run "npm install" from there.**

### **Starting Server & Running App**  
1. Open a Visual Studio Code terminal instance inside the **ToothMateServer** root folder and run **"npm run dev"** to run server. Alternatively, you can open a Windows command line instance inside the **ToothMateServer** root folder and run **"npm run dev"** from there.

2. Open Windows Command Line (or terminal instance in Visual Studio Code) and run **"ngrok http 3000"**.

3. Copy the **https forwarding url** from the running ngrok instance and paste into baseURL inside src/api/axios.js inside the ToothMateApp folder. Make sure you save the changes to axios.js with File > Save or by pressing Ctrl+S.

4. Open a Visual Studio Code terminal instance inside the **ToothMateApp** root folder and run **"npm start"" to run phone app (can also be done from Windows command line). Doing so will also open the following window in your browser.

5. To run the app on your phone, open Expo Go and press "Scan QR Code" then scan the QR code on the browser window. Ensure that your phone is on the same local network as the computer being used to run the server.

6. Alternatively, to instead run the phone app on your computer, you can install an Android or iPhone emulator and in the browser window click either **"Run on Android device/emulator"** or **"Run on iOS simulator"**.
